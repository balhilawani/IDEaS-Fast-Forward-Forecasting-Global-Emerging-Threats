# IDEaS-Fast-Forward-Forecasting-Global-Emerging-Threats

• Participated in the IDEaS Challenge, an initiative by Canada’s Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (DND/CAF) to develop machine learning models for forecasting global emerging threats.

• Developed and implemented innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to predict fatalities in armed conflicts obtaining a root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 27.4 to 37.5 and a mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 8.7 to 8.4.
